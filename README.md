# Dad_Discord_Bot
A simple dad joke discord bot


How to use:
- Use Python 3.6.0 or older
- Open an IDE and/or the command prompt
- Make sure to install ``` pip install python-dotenv ``` and ``` pip install discord.py ```

Set up a bot on the discord developer portal and replace the ``` bot.run ``` with your own token.

Don't Want to Code?
Contact me and ask for the link for the bot, I am not hosting it so I would have to start up a server manually.
